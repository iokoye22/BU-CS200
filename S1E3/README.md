## Show Notes:

### Strict Agenda:
* container labels & run labels
* rhel-tools container

### Show Recap:

I learned to navigate the internet today by trying to open the Red Hat Container Catalog with repeated fails.
For future reference, it is the [Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/search) and is [searchable](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/containers/search).

Someone asked if what I show in RHEL can be done on other platforms.
The vast majority of the time, the answer is yes!
Your best bets will be with `podman` on Fedora or CentOS.
In theory though, one of the beauties of containers is that it should run on any container runtime (e.g. docker, podman, etc.) on any Linux.
It should also run, depending on your container runtime, natively on MacOS or Windows as well.
Generally speaking, if you have used containers on the platform in question, it will probably work.
However, the caveat being those scenarios, even if you are running a container provided by Red Hat, are often unsupported.
If you are concerned about this, check the support docs.

I fall for tmux select again.
Some commentary from the peanut gallery:
```
narendev tmux mouse select is still a struggle
TheChrisShort: The mouse struggle is real
```

I struggled to get `podman inspect -f {{ .Labels }} rhel-tools` to work.
Turns out, it wasn't completely my fault.
Podman was confused whether I meant the `container` or the `container-image` as they were both called `rhel-tools`.
So, the command was correct but it needed a `--type` (or `-t`) flag for `container` or `image`.
In other words, `podman inspect -t image -f {{ .Labels }} rhel-tools`
And, for what I really wanted to show: `podman inspect -t image -f {{ .Labels.run }} rhel-tools`

I then introduced the "runlabel" command.

And how to make your own!
However, I realized in rewatching the video that I may have been unclear.
When I said "all major container runtimes support 'this'" I meant the use of the LABEL not necessarily supporting the concept of the "run label."

We revisited a topic from a prior episode "using `:z`".
In short, you want to use `:z` on your volume mounts when you want to access files from your host in your container.
**Except** when those host files are mounted from a remote host.
If you try to use `:z` on the remote files, it will fail.

Someone also asked how to run a container as root, if that is necessary.
In short, the same way you run any command as root, either `su` to the root account or put `sudo` in front the of the command.
