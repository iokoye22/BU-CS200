### Show Recap:

We opened talking about KubeCon EU (technically, [KubeCon & CloudNative Con Europe](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe)).
Mentioned a couple of interesting talks we had seen and noted, in particular, that it is the 5 year birthday of [OCI](https://opencontainers.org/)!
Couple of Red Hatters, [Sally O'Malley](https://twitter.com/somalley108) and [Urvashi Mohnani](https://twitter.com/umohnani8) gave a [keynote](https://kccnceu20.sched.com/event/ZfHO/sponsored-keynote-happy-birthday-open-container-initiative-heres-to-5-years-of-collaborative-innovation-sally-ann-omalley-software-engineer-urvashi-mohnani-software-engineer-red-hat?iframe=no) about it.

I talked a bit about moving an application from a VM or physical machine in to containers and OpenShift.
I developed a lab for Summit about the same subject.
You can go try it for yourself if you like.
You can also watch the video of me walking you through it.
However, you have to search for the talk at Red Hat Summit 20.
So if you want to see it, go to [the site](https://onlinexperiences.com/scripts/Server.nxp?LASCmd=AI:4;F:QS!10100&ShowUUID=4245E6E3-7D25-496D-9B08-4CBDC87CCE74&affiliatedata=701f2000001OH7YAAW), and then search in "Sessions & Labs" for "Containerizing applicationsâ€”existing and new"

We talked about the t-shirts we are wearing and that we should have some ones coming out for the show soon!

Discussed the separate storage areas for different users.
While this makes sense for them to be separate, if you use sudo a lot, you can easily make a mistake about which local container registry or container runtime you are using.

We also talked about the no-cost subscriptions that are available from the [Red Hat Developer Program](http://developers.redhat.com/).
If you need a subscription for Red Hat products for your development use, you should definitely check it out.

We continue to be challenged by `podman inspect` but we finally got it.
You need to be sure to use two sets of squiggly brackets (`{}`) and `"`.

We also talked about the original "container method": chroot.
We also discussed building RPMs in container with mock.

Someone brought up that there are tools to help you "clean" or obfuscate the data in a sosreport to help ensure you aren't passing sensitive information on.
One example that was provided was [soscleaner](https://github.com/soscleaner/soscleaner).
However, I would recommend that only trust this kind of tool so far.
It is often a good idea to do your own scan as well.
Someone else pointed out that you can actually ask sosreport to collect less information but the support team at Red Hat usually asks for a complete set.

We discussed how `ps` is not installed in the `support-tools` container and discussed ways around this problem.
First, we can install ps `yum install procps`.
Next, we could actually jump to the host machine and use `ps` there.
However, one we didn't think of was brought up in the chat.
We could have used `ls /proc`.
Someone else also suggested we could have used `echo $!` which will print the last background'ed PID.

We talked a bit about strace and why it is a good thing to learn.
Chris recommended checking out a talk: [GopherCon 2017: Liz Rice - A Go Programmer's Guide to Syscalls](http://www.everysession.com/gophercon/gophercon-us/2017/gophercon-2017-liz-rice-a-go-programmers-guide-to-syscalls/) even if you aren't a go programmer.

Telnet is included in the support-tools container.
And, in case your forgot, `^]` is how you escape from telnet.

We went on to discuss the discounts, exams, and classes that you might want to check out to become a Kubernetes or OpenShift admin.
You can find all the details on [The Level Up Hour page](https://red.ht/leveluphour).
